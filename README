This code sucks btw. Just doing this for fun.
Although if anyone is currently using LaTeX and is currently trying to make a matrices practice problems but google is not helping at all. This might be a good idea.

The code only works in C++. So if you don't have a console then just google a C++ console online and copy and paste the whole code.
