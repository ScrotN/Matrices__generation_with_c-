This code sucks btw. Just doing this for fun.
Although if anyone is currently using LaTeX and is currently trying to make matrices practice problems but google is not helping at all. This might help somehow.

The code only works in C++. So if you don't have a console then just google a C++ console online and copy and paste the whole code.
